    title: "The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind — Le Bon (1895)",
    text: "Crowds exhibit a collective mind distinct from individual minds. The individual in a crowd acquires a sentiment of invincible power. Anonymity produces irresponsibility. Contagion spreads feelings and acts with such rapidity that personal interests are sacrificed to the collective interest. Suggestibility replaces conscious personality. The crowd thinks in images and is moved by exaggeration, one-sidedness, and simplifications."

    text: "In crowds, every sentiment and act is contagious to such a degree that an individual readily sacrifices his personal interest to the collective interest. This is an aptitude very contrary to his nature and of which a man is scarcely capable except when he makes part of a crowd. A crowd is always intellectually inferior to the isolated individual. Crowds are only powerful for destruction."

    text: "Social life is essentially imitative. Beliefs and desires spread through society by imitation just as waves spread through water. Imitation flows downward from elites to masses, and from urban centers to rural peripheries. Fashion and custom are the two great forms of social imitation. Counter-imitation produces opposition movements."

    text: "The individual gives up his ego ideal and substitutes for it the group ideal as embodied in the leader. Groups require a leader or leading idea. Love bonds tie the group together. Members identify with each other through shared identification with the leader. Loss of the leader produces panic as libidinal ties dissolve simultaneously."

Panic arises when the group ceases to exist, when the tie with the leader and ties between members dissolve."

People are risk-averse for gains but risk-seeking to avoid losses. Reference points determine framing. Certainty effect: people overweight certain outcomes relative to probable ones. This produces systematic violations of expected utility theory."

Hubs are highly influential in information spread. Scale-free networks are robust to random node failure but highly vulnerable to targeted hub removal. Social influence concentrates in hubs."

    title: "Granovetter — Threshold Models of Collective Behavior (1978)",
    text: "Individual behavior in collective action depends on the number of others already engaged. Each person has a threshold: the proportion of the group that must act before they will act. Riots, strikes, and social movements follow threshold cascade dynamics. Small changes in threshold distribution can produce radically different collective outcomes."

    text: "If thresholds are distributed unevenly, a population can have two identical members but one produces a riot and the other produces nothing, depending on threshold distribution of others. Tipping points emerge from threshold cascade dynamics. A small shift in the distribution of thresholds can move a system from stasis to revolution."

    text: "Weak ties (acquaintances) are more valuable for information spread than strong ties (close friends) because weak ties bridge different social clusters. Information reaches more people through weak ties. Strong ties create redundancy within clusters. Bridge ties across clusters are the primary mechanism of large-scale information diffusion in social networks."

    text: "People derive self-esteem from group membership. Ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation emerge spontaneously from minimal group conditions. Social categorization drives intergroup behavior more than personal relationships. Threatened social identity increases ingroup cohesion and outgroup hostility.

    text: "Inconsistency between beliefs or between beliefs and actions creates psychological discomfort. People reduce dissonance by changing beliefs, changing behavior, or rationalizing inconsistency. Post-decision dissonance: after committing to a choice, people increase evaluation of chosen option. Dissonance reduction makes people resistant to counter-narratives after initial adoption."

Presence of other resistors dramatically reduces obedience. Legitimacy of authority context matters. Incremental escalation (foot-in-the-door) increases compliance beyond what direct requests would achieve."

    text: "In collectivist cultures (China, Japan, Arab world, Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa), narrative adoption follows community consensus dynamics. Outlier adoption is suppressed until group threshold is reached, then rapid convergence follows. In individualist cultures (US, UK, Australia, Netherlands), early adopter curves are smoother and cascades develop more gradually."

    text: "Allocentric (collectivist) individuals subordinate personal goals to ingroup goals and define self relative to group. Idiocentric (individualist) individuals prioritize personal goals and define self independently. Allocentric individuals are more susceptible to in-group social proof and less susceptible to out-group narratives. Idiocentric individuals respond more to personal benefit framing."

    text: "Post-materialist values emerge with economic security. Survival values (security focus) versus self-expression values (freedom focus) predict narrative receptivity. Traditional vs secular-rational values predict authority narrative adoption. Economic anxiety reverses post-materialist trends, increasing survival value orientation and receptivity to nationalist and security narratives."

    title: "Brady et al — Emotion Shapes Diffusion of Moralized Content on Social Media (PNAS 2017)",
    text: "Moral-emotional language increases message diffusion within political networks. Each moral-emotional word increases retweet probability by 20%. Effect is network-specific: moral-emotional content spreads within ideological communities but not across them. Moral outrage is the most contagious political emotion. Moral framing amplifies existing emotional reactions."

    title: "Acerbi et al — The Logic of Fashion Cycles (2012)",
    text: "Fashion cycles emerge from conformist and anticonformist transmission biases interacting. Conformist bias: adopt what majority does. Anticonformist bias: avoid what majority does. Interaction produces oscillations. Prestige bias (copy high-status individuals) accelerates initial adoption. Success bias (copy successful individuals) produces slower but more stable adoption."

    text: "Only 0.1% of adults accounted for 80% of fake news source visits. Fake news consumption concentrated in older, conservative-leaning users. Most social media users never encounter or share fake news. Super-spreaders of misinformation are a tiny minority with outsized influence. Platform interventions targeting high-sharing individuals could have large aggregate effects."

    text: "Simply asking people to assess the accuracy of one headline before seeing their news feed significantly reduces subsequent sharing of misinformation. Nudges to consider accuracy can have large aggregate effects with minimal cost. Social media platforms that prompt accuracy consideration could substantially reduce misinformation spread without censorship."

    text: "Financial crises follow remarkably similar patterns across centuries and countries. Overconfidence and willful amnesia cause each generation to believe their situation is unique. Debt build-up precedes every crisis. Complacency grows with stability. Sudden loss of confidence triggers rapid deleveraging. Recovery is always slower than markets anticipate."

    text: "Limits to arbitrage prevent rational actors from correcting mispricings. Noise traders with correlated beliefs can push prices far from fundamentals. Sentiment-driven investors create systematic pricing errors. Professional investors face career risk from contrarian positions. Markets can stay irrational longer than rational investors can stay solvent."

    text: "Social capital (trust, norms, networks) enables collective action and information sharing. Bridging social capital connects diverse groups. Bonding social capital strengthens ingroup ties. Declining civic participation erodes bridging capital while bonding capital persists, accelerating polarization. Low social capital environments show higher susceptibility to fear and conspiracy narratives."

    text: "High-trust societies (Germany, Japan, US, Denmark) have lower transaction costs and can form large voluntary organizations. Low-trust societies rely on family networks or state enforcement. Trust is a cultural variable that changes slowly. Institutional betrayal rapidly destroys trust that took decades to build. Narrative credibility depends critically on source trust levels."

    text: "Global trust in institutions remains at historically low levels. Business is the most trusted institution globally, ahead of government and media. NGOs have lost trust significantly. Peer trust (someone like me) has risen relative to expert trust. Economic anxiety is the primary driver of institutional distrust. Polarized societies show the largest trust gaps."
